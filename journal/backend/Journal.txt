Issue with sending promise<pending> to frontend for data visualization. Imported object interface to utils.ts, where we used an async
function to fetch data via 2 PromQL queries. The data was being fetched inside of utils; however, when reaching the main.ts forEach function,
the await attached to the forEach method was not resolving.

We swapped the forEach method for a for loop, but also discovered that this can be done via promise.all. This is because Promise.all will resolve
an array of promises<pending>, whereas an await without promise.all is expecting a SINGULAR promise.

LOOK AT TYPES OF DATA THAT IS BEING RETURNED.

change PromQL queries for memory to:
const query = `${prometheusURL}query_range?query=sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes${namespaceStr}) 
                  by (pod)&start=${startDateTime}&end=${endDateTime}&step=${"1m"}`;

takes a little bit of time to load
